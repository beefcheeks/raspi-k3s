# By default, k3s uses separate CIDRs for pods and services
# multus only detects the pod CIDR and not the service CIDR
# As a result, k8s service requests are routed via the external interface
# This includes kube-dns, which can only be routed through the pod interface
# This patch is intended for other apps' StatefulSets that use the multus interface
